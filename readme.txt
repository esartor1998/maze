you know, you gotta give me some credit, despite all my rage in discovering last minute that my 
entire world generation strategy was wrong according to the spec i really recovered. if by recovered
you mean i replaced all my old code with a comment reading "three rows" and barely got half of it
working the way @dcalvert wanted while incessantly complaining the whole time, and then fell alseep
at 11 on the day of the due date after doing it because i could no longer stay up and then as a
result was unable to finish the most important part of the maze post-quadtree removal (the corridors)

you can use g to toggle gravity and f to toggle flying. you can use these tools to see that everything
is in its right place, except the corridors, and also that gravity and the stair motion also work.

-The web page at:

contains a good explanation of how to determine the viewing frustum for
a viewpoint in OpenGL. There is also some useful code there.
